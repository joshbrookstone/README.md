# What is character encoding

* words and sentences in text are created from characters.

* characters needed for a specific purposed are goruped into a character set(called a repertoire)
  * each character is associated witha  number, called a code point)
* Characters are stored in the computer as one or more bytes
* All charactesr are stored in computers using a special code, 

A character encoding provides a key to unlock the code

* so when we type into a computer, the character encoding maps characters to a specific byte in the comp memory, and then to display the text it uses an encoding to read the bytes back to text

* fonts are a collection of glyph definitions. IE definitions of the shapes used to displa characters.

* choose UTF-8. this unicdoe encoding is a good choice because you can use a single character encoding to handle any character you are likely to need.
