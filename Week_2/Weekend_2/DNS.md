# Domain Name System : DNS

The basics:

* we need DNS for the internet to exist
* DNS changes a big chain of letters into a name of a computer
* www.google.com.
  * that end dot is the root of the internet DNS
Resolving name server looks for this . and looks to see if its memory or cache. 
Root name servers say IDK, but can find the top level domain name.puts it in its casche, than the com tld name server looks for the name...omg this video
* DNS works fast

different types of DNS record Types

A: map a hostnames to ip ADdress
NS : name server
MX: Mail exchange
CNAME: canonical name; an alias
