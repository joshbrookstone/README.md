# Intro to Networking

* Definition of computer network: A (Computer) Network is when two or more computers are connected and can communicate with each other.

**When we talk about networking, we are not simply talking about the internet.**

The internet is a network. but a network is not the internet. 

Networking makes the internet possible. but networking happens on an even smallers scale

# Intro to TCP

TCP : _Transmission Control Protocol_, provides a standard that allows machines to speak to each other.

* TCP communication allows two machines to establish an open channel for two-way data communication.

  * Just like a phone call, there is always one side which dieals a specific number to establish a connection to the other side. In computer networking, this number is an IP Address.

  ports in computer networking are like the different offices of a company.

## Video Notes

* how do they talk?
  * through a connection that is established. this is a network

* example of a router:
  * all computers set up to a router

* local area network: LAN
  * MY router and my computer
  * My neighbors router and their computer

* Network interface card NIC:
  * How computers talk

* Wide area network: WAN 
   * an office campus with a:
    * multiple routers
    * connecting to a bigger network

* Mac Address:
  * a name of a computer. 
  * unique to each computers NIC
  * it is a hexadecimals of 6 bytes

* How computers talk:
  * When they want to talk, they share a medium
  * a medium like a cable
  * each computer has a NIC card with its own Mac address
  * address each other with their Mac address
  * other computers can see this message if on the same medium, but cna ignore if not addressed to them

* Collision detection/Avoidance
  * If too many computers are talking on the same network, it can get crazy.

* Conclusion:

Computer networks allow computers/devices to send messages to each other. These operations take time, even more time than a computer takes to write to its own disk, for example.

TCP is a specific type of protocol (aka guideline, standard, agreement) which is commonly used to structure the data and workflow of data over the network.
