# Inheritance

* as we start to create different types of objects, inevitable we start to notice some code duplication.

* to solve this, we can take code shared by two calsses and group them using something called **inheritance**

* With inheritance, we can build a new class based on an existing class

* We can make a grouping for the code that is shared into a single class. than we can EXTEND the class into new classes with the extends keyword.

extensions of a class are a subclass, they inherit the code inside the superclass
