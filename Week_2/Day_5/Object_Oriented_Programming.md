# Intro to Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

# What is Object Oreientation

* abbreviated as "OO", is probably the biggest concept in software dev philosophy in the last 30 years

* over the last 2 weeks, we have broken down code into bits and peieces. this allowed for our code to be used in other places/high modularity.

* OO uses objects to keep our code modular and reduce repetition

Some languages uses *functional programming* versus Object oriented

## is JS 'OO'?

* JS has multiple paradigms. its a bit of both. ES6 has introduced more OOP features

## Conclusion

* OO is a software dev paradigm
* is popular way to solve code oragnization
* JS is not strictly OO in the way that Java and Ruby are
* JS also encourages Functional Programming
