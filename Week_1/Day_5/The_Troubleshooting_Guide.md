# The Trouble Shooting Guide

## **Before you get stuck!**

### Have I...

  * psuedo-coded the solution?

  * googled the error message I am getting?

  * actualy READ the error message?

  * double-checked my syntax?

  * linted my code?

  * pair programmed or gotten a peer to code review?

  * rubber-ducked the problem?


If the answer to all of these questions is yes, then you have done your due diligence and should be calling a mentor over?
