# Automated Testing

* Automated testing is the practice of writing code to programatically test the actual code we want to write

* Benefits of Auto-testing:

  1. Saves times
  2. catches bugs early
  3. makes it easier to program
  4. makes it easier to come back and prgroam
  5. makes it easier to work together
  6. acts as documentation
  7. improves quality of our code

  ## There are different kinds of testing

  * Unit testing
  * Integration testing
  * functioncal testing 

  [Info on all three](https://codeutopia.net/blog/2015/04/11/what-are-unit-testing-integration-testing-and-functional-testing/)


## Find the happy path

[Happy path](https://effectivecio.com/2009/11/02/the-happy-path/)

* The happy path is a path through a system where:

  1. everything works
  2. data is correct
  3. the system stays up
  4. the users are well-behaved

There is even more testing off the happy path. **BUT**, use the 80/20 rule. 80 percent of your time on the happy path test, 20 percent in the weeds testing other small bugs
