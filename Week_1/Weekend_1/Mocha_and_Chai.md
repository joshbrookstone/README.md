# Mocha and Chai Intro

## BDD: Behavior Driven Development

* A process that emerged from test-driven development in 2006. 

* BDD covers the entire life cycle of the app development process, from planning the project to writing the code.

## BDD Frameworks

* when we write tests, we are testing the behavior of our code.

* Some tests are more complicated than others, but every test will involve setting up some data, running some code that should do something, and asserting that it does that thing.
