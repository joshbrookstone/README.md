# Packages and npm

## Packages

* What are packages?

  * Packages are self-contained code libraries that we can install and use in our projects.

### Dependencies in package.json

* The dependencies section of package.json lists the packages that need to be installed for the project to run properly. In the above example it lists a package called express, and the value ^4.13.4 specifies the version.

### require For Installed Packages

* require allows us to import any installed packages into our JS files within our working directory
