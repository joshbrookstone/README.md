# JQuery

# Why does JQuery exist?

1. Fixes Browser compatibility issues
  * things run different in chrome vs. IE
  * so we can use a JQuery tag iike (window).width(). this will set the right documentation on all browsers

2. Cleaner API

3. Events and Callbacks

* actions are constantly occuring on the webpage, but the dev is only notified about them if they are listening. listening for an event means your waiting for the browser to tell you that specific event has occured, and then youll specify how the paoge shoule react

* to specify what to do, we use an eventhandler
