# What is a stack?

* A stack often refers to the collection of tech used in a given system

* For instance, tinyapp has the following stack:
  1. Web Server: Node.js
  2. Middleware: Express
  3. Templated Engine: EJS
  Database: none, just an 'in memory Object'.
  
  * it could also inclue infrastructure:
  4. Hosting/infrastructure: Heroku

* In theory, any of these could be swapped out for other ones

* FUll stack is just someone comfortable with frotn and back end teck
