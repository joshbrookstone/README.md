# HTML and CSS

* basic word of htyml is a 'tage', html makes an element in the dom tree. an element starts at the begining tag until the end tag. in between is content. inside of a tage can be empty, or anoterh tag. tags can have attributes

* CSS defines the style, using syntax and rules to change elements of html pages.

* Html can provide the broswer with what styles to use from CSS.

# styling with CSS

there are three ays to add css rules to a page:

1. diirectly to an elemnt, eg ```js <p style='color: red'></p>```
2. iunline with html using a style tage
3. or link to a css file using a link tage.

first two are bad practice, third is better and helps to avboid coupling of structure and style code
