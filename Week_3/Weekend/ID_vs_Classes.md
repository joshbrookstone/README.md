# IDs vs Classes

* WHen should uyou use an ID(to uniquely identify)vvs a class (to gernally classify) an element?

an element can have only one ID, but it can have many classes.

* we can targe elemnt by id with a hashtage prefiex: #buy-now-main-btn

* We can targe element by class using a selector with a period/dot prefix: .nav-item. these elements can occur anywhere

## Multiple classes

* an element can have 0 to n classes

  * classes imply stylistic or behavioral properties about an element

* a geeeral rule, classes should be used much more frequently than ID's

__Id's may be used when you have a uniqure element such as a call tyo action that is styled and/or behaves very differently than other elements on a page or website__

* ids also need to be used when you need to reference them from the url using the anchor hash value

* usinbg ID's might be more performant for a computer cause your targeting only one thing, but overall can lead to less readable code. so be careful


OVeral..dont use either if you dont need either

* you can always target any element without giving it a class or ID

## video

* iD used once on a page to identify
* Class is an identifir wrapping a thing that can be used on many different things

* id is an attribute

* these just describe things, they dont do anything just yet without some styling in css
