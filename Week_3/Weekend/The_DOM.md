# The DOM

## Whats the dom?

* WHen a page is loadeed for users to swee, the browser is runing a process that creates a Document Object Mdoel (The DOM) in memeory to represent all of the HTML code on that page. Each HTML ele is also called a 'node' or DOM node, not the same as Nodejs

* at the most basic leve, a website consists of an HTML doc. the browser that uyuou use to view the website is aprogram that inerprets HTML and CSS and renders tehs tyle, content, and structure into the page that you see.

* in addition to parsing the style ands structures of HTML and CSS, the browser creates a representation of the doc known as the DOM. this model allows JS to access the text content and elemtns of the website document as **objects**

* the Document object is a built in object that has many properties and methods that we can use to access and modify websites.

* The dom is modified by client side JS
* The browser automaticallly fixes erros in the source code
